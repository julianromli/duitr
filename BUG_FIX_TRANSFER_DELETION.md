# Transfer Deletion Bug Fix

## Issue Summary
When deleting a transfer transaction, the source wallet balance was correctly refunded, but the destination wallet balance was not decremented, causing inconsistent wallet balances.

## Root Cause
The `deleteTransaction` function in `FinanceContext.tsx` had a critical flaw in error handling:

1. ✅ Transaction deletion from database succeeded
2. ❌ Wallet balance updates could fail silently 
3. ✅ Local state was always updated (masking the database inconsistency)
4. ✅ Success toast was shown even if database updates failed

**The problem:** Wallet update errors were logged but **not thrown**, allowing the function to continue executing and show success even when the database updates failed.

## The Fix
Enhanced error handling in the `deleteTransaction` function (lines 932-968 in `FinanceContext.tsx`):

### Before (Silent Failures):
```javascript
const { error: fromWalletError } = await supabase
  .from('wallets')
  .update({ balance: updatedFromWallet!.balance })
  .eq('id', updatedFromWallet!.id);
if (fromWalletError) console.error("Error updating source wallet:", fromWalletError);
// ❌ Function continues even on error!
```

### After (Proper Error Handling):
```javascript
const { error: fromWalletError } = await supabase
  .from('wallets')
  .update({ balance: updatedFromWallet!.balance })
  .eq('id', updatedFromWallet!.id);

if (fromWalletError) {
  console.error("Error updating source wallet:", fromWalletError);
  throw new Error(`Failed to update source wallet balance: ${fromWalletError.message}`);
  // ✅ Function stops execution and shows error to user
}
```

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced source wallet update error handling** - Now throws error if source wallet balance update fails
2. **Enhanced destination wallet update error handling** - Now throws error if destination wallet balance update fails  
3. **Improved error messages** - More descriptive error messages for better debugging
4. **Consistent error handling** - Applied the same pattern to all wallet update operations

## Testing
Created comprehensive test suite (`transfer-deletion-bug.test.tsx`) that validates:

1. ✅ **Correct balance calculations** - Ensures transfer reversal logic is mathematically correct
2. ✅ **Both wallet updates** - Verifies that both source and destination wallets are updated
3. ✅ **Error handling** - Confirms that database update failures are properly caught and reported

## Impact
- **Before:** Silent failures could lead to wallet balance inconsistencies
- **After:** All database update failures are caught and reported to the user
- **User Experience:** Users now get accurate feedback when operations fail
- **Data Integrity:** Wallet balances remain consistent between database and local state

## Test Results
```
✓ should properly update both wallet balances when deleting a transfer
✓ should handle database update errors properly
```

Both tests pass, confirming the fix addresses the original issue while maintaining proper error handling.
